It can integrate various software package and environment management systems from environment modules to Docker, Singularity, and Conda. It allows for existing pipelines written in common scripting languages, such as R and Python, to be seamlessly coupled together. It implements a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that simplifies the implementation and running of workflows on cloud or high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructures.</p> <p>This lesson also introduces nf-core: a community-driven platform, which provide peer reviewed best practice analysis pipelines written in Nextflow and nf-tower(centralized command post for the management of Nextflow data pipelines.)</p>"},{"location":"episodes/1_introduction/","title":"Introduction to Workflow management systems and Nextflow","text":""},{"location":"episodes/2_nf_scripting/","title":"Nextflow scripting","text":""},{"location":"episodes/3_wf_parametrisation/","title":"Workflow Parametrisation","text":""},{"location":"episodes/4_channels/","title":"Channels","text":""}]}
